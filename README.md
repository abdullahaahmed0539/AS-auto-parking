# AS-auto-parking
In this project, we try to park a car in an empty space. It uses a machine learning technique called K-means clustering for doing its task. (Intro to AI project, 4th Semester, Bachelors of computer science)

NOTE: 
a) Python files graphics.py and graphics_demo.py handle GUI only. These files are contained under the folder “GUI”. Whereas backend folder contains backend files      in java.
b) graphic.py is open source.

How to run the program:

  1)Change the directory in each code. When the java code will run it will make new files by the name AI.txt and path.txt.
  2)If you just want to see the gui just run the python code.
  3)Make sure that path.txt and AI.txt are in the same folder as main.java and graphics_demo.py.
